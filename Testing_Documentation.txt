Test Plan
We want to make sure everything in the app works as expected, so we'll be testing these main commands:

add <habit_name>: Add a new habit to your list.
done <habit_name>: Mark a habit as done for the day.
delete <habit_name>: Remove a habit from the list.
list: See all your habits with their statuses.
exit: Close the app when you're done.
Testing Method: We'll do manual testing — just running through the commands and checking everything works as it should. If something doesn’t go as expected, we'll note it down.
