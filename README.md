# Daily Habit Tracker  

## Description  
Welcome to Daily Habit Tracker! ðŸŽ¯ This is a simple, no-fuss CLI application we built to help you stay on top of your daily habits. Whether itâ€™s exercising, reading, or just remembering to drink water, this app has got you covered. Itâ€™s lightweight, quick to use, and perfect for people who donâ€™t want complicated tools.  

## Installation Instructions  
Setting it up is super easy:  
1. First, clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/habit-tracker.git
   ```  
2. Jump into the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd habit-tracker
   ```  
3. Install the dependencies (we only need one, so itâ€™s quick):  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
4. Run the app and start tracking:  
   ```bash
   python habit_tracker.py
   ```  

Thatâ€™s it. No rocket science here. ðŸš€  

## Usage Guide  
Hereâ€™s how you can use the app (itâ€™s really simple):  
- `add <habit_name>`: Adds a new habit to your list.  
- `done <habit_name>`: Marks a habit as done for the day.  
- `delete <habit_name>`: Deletes a habit you no longer need to track.  
- `list`: Shows all your habits with their statuses (green = done, red = not done).  
- `exit`: Closes the app when youâ€™re done.  

### Example:  
```bash
> add Drink Water  
Added habit: Drink Water  

> done Drink Water  
Marked 'Drink Water' as done.  

> list  
Your habits:  
Drink Water - âœ… Done  

> exit  
Goodbye! ðŸ‘‹  
```  

## Technical Stack  
We kept it simple because, honestly, thatâ€™s all you need:  
- **Python**: Because itâ€™s great for projects like this.  
- **termcolor**: To make things look a little nicer with colors.  

## Features  
- Add, track, and delete your habits.  
- Colored status to make it obvious which habits are done (green) and which arenâ€™t (red).  
- No fluff, just functionality.  

## Team Members  
Weâ€™re a small but mighty team:  
- **Azat**: The fearless team leader who kept us on track.  
- **Ibragim**: Tested everything like a pro and caught the sneaky bugs.  
- **Said**: Wrote this documentation and helped make the app shine.  

## Screenshots/Demo  
(Weâ€™ll add screenshots here soon. Imagine something awesome for now!)

### Final Words  
We had fun building this project, and we hope itâ€™s just as fun for you to use. If you spot anything weird or have ideas for improvements, let us know (or better yet, contribute to the code)! Happy habit tracking!
