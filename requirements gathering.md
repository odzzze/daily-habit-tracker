Requirements Gathering
User Interview 
We imagined two users:

Deniz, 22years , student: He needs an app to help him track his habits. He often forgets things and wants a simple app that will remind him.
Marie, 28, office worker: She wants to track things like exercising and reading. She doesn’t need a complex app—just something that works quickly and simply.
What the app should do:

Let users add new habits.
Mark habits as done.
Delete habits.
All of this should be done with easy, straightforward commands.

How the app should work? The app should be super simple to uswe with no complicated settings, and it should work quickly.
 
 2.System Design
The app will store habit data temporarily. Users will type commands in a simple text interface.

What will be in the app:
Habit is a class that represents each habit with name and statuse.
HabitTracker is a class that keeps track of all the habits.
What the interface will look like?
 The interface will just be text-based with commands like those:

add — to add a habit
done — to mark a habit as done
delete — to delete a habit
list — to show all the habits
3. Implementation
GitHub Repository: In the GitHub repo, we have:

The main app file (habit_tracker.py).
A file for any dependencies (if needed).
A README.md with instructions for installation and usage.
Code Comments: We’ll write comments in the code to make sure it’s clear how everything works.

4. User Manual
The user manual will be short and simple:

add habit_name — to add a new habi
done habit_name — to mark a habit as done
delete habit_name — to delete a habit
list — tto see all your habits
5. Deliverables
GitHub: All the project files will be in the GitHub repo, neatly organized with a clear README.md file.

PDF Presentation: The presentation will be simple but to the point. We’ll explain what we did, how we solved problems, and show the final result.
