Future Improvements
We love where the Daily Habit Tracker is going, but hey, there’s always room to add some extra sparkle! Here are a few fun ideas that could take it to the next level:

1. Data Persistence (So You Don’t Lose Your Progress!)
Right now, all your hard work vanishes as soon as you close the app. 😱 Let's fix that! We could add a feature to save your habits to a file (like a cozy little JSON or text file) or even a mini database. That way, you can pick up right where you left off without losing all those "Exercise" checks you’ve been so proud of!

2. Reminders and Notifications (So You Don’t Forget!)
Let’s be honest—sometimes, we all forget to do our habits. 🙈 What if the app could give you a little nudge, like "Hey, don’t forget to drink water today!"? That would help keep you on track and make the app even more helpful.

3. Improved User Interface (Let’s Add Some Color!)
Right now, our CLI is clean and simple, but how about we add some color to jazz things up? Imagine seeing your completed habits in a nice, vibrant green and the undone ones in bold red, so you can instantly see what’s happening. 🌈 (And who doesn’t love a pop of color?)

4. Tracking Habit Streaks (Because You’re on a Roll!)
Wouldn’t it be awesome to see how many days in a row you’ve kept up with your habits? A habit streak counter would be a fun challenge, and maybe just the motivation you need to hit a new personal record! 🎯

5. Multi-User Support (For Group Habits!)
Right now, it’s a solo mission, but how about turning it into a group activity? Imagine being able to track habits with your friends or family. Everyone could have their own habits and see who’s got the best streak! 🏆

6. Mobile App Version (So You Can Track on the Go!)
Why keep it on the computer when you can track your habits from anywhere? We could create a mobile version of the app so you can stay on top of your habits no matter where you are. Whether you’re on the bus, at a coffee shop, or binge-watching your favorite show, you’ll never forget your "Drink Water" habit again. ☕📱

7. Gamification (Who Doesn’t Love a Challenge?)
What if tracking habits was more like playing a game? 🎮 We could add points, badges, and achievements to make it a fun challenge. The more you stick with your habits, the more rewards you unlock! It’s like getting an A+ for being awesome at life.
